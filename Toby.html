        <p><b>Toby was always interested in very nerdy things; like alarm systems<br>, and showed a strong interest in how things worked.<br> He would discover how these things worked generally through<br> brute force, and would sit looking for patterns on circuit boards<br> of his newly destroyed things. This interest turned to code,<br> where Toby built his first website at 7 years old. This vanilla<br> HTML website took him many days to complete, and looked<br> terrible; but he was hooked.</b></p>
